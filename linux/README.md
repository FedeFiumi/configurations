LINUX CONFIGURATION GUIDE

## Set up command aliases
1) Add the following snippet to .bashrc in the root directory (~):


  ```
  # Alias definitions.
  # You may want to put all your additions into a separate file like
  # ~/.bash_aliases, instead of adding them here directly.
  # See /usr/share/doc/bash-doc/examples in the bash-doc package.

  if [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then
      . ~/.bash_aliases
  fi
  ```

2) Copy the file `aliases\.bash_aliases` in the root directory (~)

3) Copy directory `aliases\utilities` in the root directory (~)

4) Close all the open terminal and re-open it, DONEEEEEEE! YEEEEEEAH B-)
